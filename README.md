# Hudson and Thames Sphinx Theme

This is the Sphinx theme for Hudson and Thames packages documentation. It is based on the
``sphinx_rtd_theme`` project, but uses a different style and links to connect all packages and
research articles.

To use the Hudson and Thames Sphinx theme, add ``hudsonthames_sphinx_theme`` to the requirements list,
and change the following line in the documentation config file:

``html_theme = 'hudsonthames_sphinx_theme'``
